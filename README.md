# universal-ocpp-bridge

Universal OCPP bridge for the external protocols

See [the architecture and implementation plan](.agents/PLAN.md) for the agreed scope,
Rust service and simulator architecture, selectable MQTT and EMS/SCADA targets
(direct API or optional MQTT broker), extensible target/data contracts, connection
protocols, external database export, browser debugging, staging, automatic
rollback, and CI/release strategy.

Implementation has started with the buildable workspace foundation. Charging
behavior, simulator scenarios, CI workflows, and release tooling remain planned.

## Workspace foundation

The initial Rust modular-monolith workspace is organized into protected
contracts/domain/application crates, outward-facing adapter crates, and separate
service, simulator, and release-manager executables. See
[ADR 0001](docs/architecture/0001-modular-monolith-boundaries.md) for the package
rules and first-release exclusions.

The canonical HTTP, MQTT, and export JSON contracts are published as versioned Draft 2020-12
schemas under `crates/contracts/schemas`. See
[`docs/contracts/json-schema-versioning.md`](docs/contracts/json-schema-versioning.md) for the v1
compatibility policy and regeneration command.

Run the current foundation checks with:

```text
./scripts/verify-workspace.sh
```

The command uses a local Cargo toolchain when Cargo, rustfmt, and Clippy are
available. Otherwise it automatically runs the checks in the pinned
`rust:1.85.1-bookworm` Docker image. Install Rust with rustup or ensure Docker is
installed and running.

Runtime bridge, environment, release, process, and selected-target identity is owned by the
service at startup. See [runtime identity configuration](docs/configuration/runtime-identity.md)
for production defaults and isolated staging/demo examples.

Diagnostic observations are centrally redacted and serialized before any downstream sink can see
them. See [the diagnostic redaction boundary](docs/security/diagnostic-redaction.md) for the typed
safe-field policy, fail-closed vendor payload handling, and inert-renderer requirement.

Normal release promotion is fail-closed on real old-to-new-to-old data evidence. See the
[reversible release compatibility policy](docs/operations/release-compatibility.md) for schema
ranges, additive migration rules, configuration projections, and security floors.

OCPP release coverage is tracked separately from implementation claims. See the
[independent OCPP fixture corpus](docs/testing/ocpp-fixture-corpus.md) for pinned specification
provenance, hand-authored wire fixtures, the coverage-to-test matrix, and its fail-closed release
gate.
