# universal-ocpp-bridge

Universal OCPP bridge for the external protocols

See [the architecture and implementation plan](.agents/PLAN.md) for the agreed scope,
Rust service and simulator architecture, selectable MQTT and EMS/SCADA targets
(direct API or optional MQTT broker), extensible target/data contracts, connection
protocols, external database export, browser debugging, staging, automatic
rollback, and CI/release strategy.

Implementation has started with the buildable workspace foundation. Charging
behavior, simulator scenarios, CI workflows, and release tooling remain planned.

## Workspace foundation

The initial Rust modular-monolith workspace is organized into protected
contracts/domain/application crates, outward-facing adapter crates, and separate
service, simulator, and release-manager executables. See
[ADR 0001](docs/architecture/0001-modular-monolith-boundaries.md) for the package
rules and first-release exclusions.

Run the current foundation checks with:

```text
./scripts/verify-workspace.sh
```
